        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 50px;">In the context of a city, it is currently costly, time consuming and inefficient to transport items across short distances. The current method to deliver a small item from one suburb to the next involves transport via a vehicle with a weight which
            far exceeds the weight of the delivery, requiring costly fuel and increasing levels of city congestion.<br></h2>

                            <p class="description">The first week involved forming groups and choosing a technology and problem to solve. My group were interested in pursuing a technology which is innovative and cutting edge, but which could practicably be implemented in the
                                near future. We settled on the technology of delivery drones because these are already being developed by companies such as Amazon as a viable solution for transporting small items over short distances However, we differentiated
                                our design by focusing on peer-to-peer delivery rather than large-scale distribution from warehouse to consumer (as is the case with many existing drone delivery services). This meant that we were able to experiment with
                                designing an interface for a more complex ordering process in which two users must communicate with each other to load, send and receive a package in an autonomous drone. <br></p>

                                    our ideas were broad, and all contributions were welcomed. Eventually we began to hone down on the ideas we considered most innovative and applicable to the problem. To develop a more nuanced understanding of the problem
                                    from a user’s perspective, I wrote persona’s which explored the use of the drone delivery service in a realistic scenario. We then explored three divergent ideas with storyboards and low fidelity wireframes. Eventually,
                                    we evaluated these designs, in part informed by feedback during initial user testing sessions, and settled on the idea of a peer-to-peer autonomous delivery service which allows users to send items to other users in

                            <p class="description">After establishing the basic requirements of our mobile application, we sketched user interface elements and wireframed the progression of a user through the drone ordering process. Because two users must coordinate when loading
                                and unloading an item from the drone, we had to develop wireframes which depicted the actions of both the sender and the recipient of an item. <br><br>At first, we wireframed individually and then consolidated the best
                                elements of different designs. This worked well, however it would be interesting to experiment with wireframing more collaboratively from the beginning, which may have resulted in a more coherent flow between screens. <br></p>

            developed and implemented interface solutions to improve the match between physical and digital. We recognized that animations would be a crucial method of conveying the functionality of some of the main elements of the app, such as&nbsp;showing
            which way the drone is moving, or the difference in item size. With this in mind, our main focus moving forward was to bring our interactive prototype to life with animations and conduct further tesing.<br></h2><h1 id="sub">Flow</h1>

                            the design evolved and various iterations were developed, user testing was undertaken to assess the impact of each major change to the interface. All sessions were recorded, and transcripts were typed up. Photos were also taken
                            to document the process and communicate the testing to stakeholders.<br></p>
